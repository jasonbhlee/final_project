- Make sure you pull before working on the project, and Pull before pushing any changes.

- Message Teams chat to let team know which files you are currently working on; to prevent merge conflicts.

- When working on something, Pull from the main branch, then copy paste it into a local folder that you can work on.
(We arent going to use branches, incase it breaks merging again)

-When you have a working build, Pull the main, then copy paste your changes into the intended locations. Then push the changes.

- When you want to install node modules folder to your local computer, just run: 
	npm install
- to run the programs:

- navigate to the back end folder, npm install, then npm run. Then open a second terminal, and do the same thing for the front end.

- the Registration page is working (sign in page isnt)

- to bypass the sign in to view the other pages, just use /home in the URL bar.
